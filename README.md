The link to download the files to create the tables and run the mySQL code is here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TnLRUfC1OrvTrsrVfAzg7FA5S8SdS7mr/view?usp=sharing.

Performance Tip: It is recommended to store the files on an SSD for the fastest performance. If you are using an HDD and encounter timeout errors, you can adjust the MySQL timeout settings to run the larger file sizes.
