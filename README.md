The 'Code Files' folder contains .sql files, while the "Output File" folder contains the output for the 'SQL Queries on Lichess' file only. Note that the 'Loading in Lichess Datasets' file does not have any corresponding output in the Output File folder since it is only generating tables.

The results for the queries in the 'SQL Queries on Lichess' file are limited to 20 in order to make the 'SQL Queries on Lichess Output' file much more readable.

The link to download the files to create the tables and run the MySQL code in the 'SQL Queries on Lichess' file is here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TnLRUfC1OrvTrsrVfAzg7FA5S8SdS7mr/view?usp=sharing.

Performance Tip: It is recommended to store the files on an SSD for the fastest performance for running queries. If you are using an HDD and encounter timeout errors, you can adjust the MySQL timeout settings to run the larger file sizes.
