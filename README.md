Open the Lichess Query Results file in Notepad if you'd like to view the output of the SQL Queries on Lichess file without downloading the data files needed to run the code.

The results for the queries in the SQL Queries on Lichess file are limited to 20 in order to make the Lichess Query Results file much more readable.

The link to download the files to create the tables and run the mySQL code is here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TnLRUfC1OrvTrsrVfAzg7FA5S8SdS7mr/view?usp=sharing.

Performance Tip: It is recommended to store the files on an SSD for the fastest performance. If you are using an HDD and encounter timeout errors, you can adjust the MySQL timeout settings to run the larger file sizes.
